# 10XOne Test Project

## Running the project

The project was made in .NET Core 2.2.4, so you need a compatible dotnet CLI or Visual Studio to run the project.

## Known bugs

The datepicker does not accept the given dateformat for some reason, so does not show the date of a previously stored financial item.
